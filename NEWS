Version 0.17 2/8/12
-------------------
This release includes new HTTP signatures, the ability to catch different
types of HTTP attacks and SSH and Dovecot attacks.

Version 0.16 1/2/11
-------------------
This release includes new HTTP signatures, faster response to prohibit
attackers' access, and portability to Apple's Darwin operating system.

Version 0.15.1 1/8/10
---------------------
This release includes no new features, it contains bug fixes, minor
improvements and new HTTP signatures.

Version 0.15 20/4/10
--------------------
This release includes major new features.
Sniff2ban now uses autoconf, so instead of editing the #defines within
	sniff2ban.c, just type "./configure".
The first draft of a monitor system for cracking attempts to port 80 has
	been added.
OpenBSD and FreeBSD are now supported.
The -W flag has been added, with this option data from white-listed IP addresses
	are no longer scanned. Without it the data are scanned, however
	the IP address is not blocked.

Version 0.10 12/2/10
--------------------
This release includes some new features and bug fixes.
Sniff2ban is now able to handle very long hostnames.
If the socket to talk to clamd isn't given, sniff2ban now looks in the
clamd.conf file for the information.
Added HAVE_NETSTAT_WIDE. Some netstats don't have the -W option, sniff2ban
is now able to use lsof on those environments.

Version 0.07 20/12/09
---------------------
This release includes new features.
Hostnames can now be whitelisted as well as IP addresses.
The --kill-programs option has been added which kills programs receiving
malware. This works particularly well with sendmail when the sanesecurity
database has been installed, since it terminates sessions much quicker than
other methods, saving resources.
The --sacred-program option allows programs to be named that won't be killed,
it's useful to add squid to this list.

Version 0.06 12/5/09
--------------------
This release includes some tidyups and minor changes to functionality. It is
quicker at noticing the end of a connection thereby freeing system resources
earlier, it uses fewer resources when modifying the system's firewall and
allows /netmask to be added to a whitelist address, e.g. "-w 192.168.1.0/8".

Version 0.05 16/4/09
--------------------
This release includes a major rewrite. If it is available, sniff2ban
will now make use of the pcap library. This ehances the portability of
sniff2ban which is now available for FreeBSD, Solaris and NetBSD in
addition to Linux. The "-d" feature only works for Linux for now, I plan to
port that to other platforms soon.

Version 0.04 8/4/09
-------------------
This release allows the communications method to ClamAV to be specified at
the command line. Prior to this release the communication method needed to
be hardcoded into the source.

To use UNIX domain sockets, specify the full path name in the command line.
To use Internet domain sockets, specify the hostname:portnumber pair.

Version 0.03 30/3/09
--------------------

This is a a bug fix release which corrects a problem detected by Valgrind.

Version 0.02 26/3/09
--------------------

This is a bug fix release which tidies up better. In particular the files
in /tmp should now all be removed when the program finishes, and the interface
will leave promiscuous mode.
A new option "-s" has been added to not add the outgoing interface (ourselves)
to the firewall. Its use is encouraged.
